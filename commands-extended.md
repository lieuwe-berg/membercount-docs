### Counter

> The bot's most important command. With this command you can toggle counters on and off. The channels can also be updated with this command, using `m!counter update`. 
>
> **Examples:**

> m!counter users on => turns the user counter on
> m!counter channels off => turns the channels counter off.

> m!counter <counter> <on/off>
> m!counter update
> ```
>
> #### Aliases

### Counter Name \(Patrons only\)

> Changes the name of the specified counter. The available counters are member, user, bot, roles, channels. Include `{count}` in the name, where you want the count \(the number\) to be. 
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> m!countername user {count} very cool people
> ```

> ```
