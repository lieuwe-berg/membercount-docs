# Changelog

## 11 April 2019

### Online and Offline Counters

* Yes yes, they are here \(experimental\)! Again they are for tier 2 patrons only.
* The counters update every minute instead of when a member turns online/offline.

### Role Counter

* Added a limit of 5 per server.

### Member List

* Member list is no longer a premium feature.
* Tier 2 patron is required for all members to be cached. \(This essentially means that without premium, some information may be missing\)
* New options!!!

  `-created` include the account creation dates of the members.

  `-joined` include the server join dates of the members.

  `-roles` include the roles of the members

### Premium

* Fix bug of certain tier 1 patron users being able to use tier 2 features.

### Info

* Adds a percentage to the memory.
* The memory usage should be closer to the actual one. 

### Member List

* Member list is now a premium feature \(tier 2\) since it requires a large amount of ram to cache all members. 
* It includes all members of the server unlike before. 
* It requires you ~~to be lieuwe, CHamburr, or~~ to have the Administrator permission. 

### Role Counter

* Yes it's here! This counts all members in a role. This is a premium feature \(tier 2 as well\). 
* To add or remove a new role, `m!counter role <add/remove> <role>`.
* `role` can either be specified by a mention or simply type out the role name \(Case sensitive\). 
* To change the name of the counter, `m!countername role <role> <new name>`. 
* In the case of changing counter name, if the role is longer than one word, wrap it with `"`. 

That's all! Have fun with the new counter, and to become a patron, go to [https://www.patreon.com/member\_count](https://www.patreon.com/member_count)

### Member Count v2 is released!

The time has come.   
This is the biggest update we've ever had.   
****TL;DR Brand new counters, huge performance improvements, as well as general changes.

### **New features**

* Added 2 new counters. Channel count and role count.
* Added aliases for various commands, such as `m!info` \(aliases: `about`, `stats`\) and `m!category` \(alias: `cat`\).
* New command: `m!counter update`. You can now update the counters manually.

### Mentionable changes

* The bot now recognises counters by channel ID instead of name.
* The commands `m!membercount`, `m!botcount` and `m!usercount` are combined as one. It is changed to `m!counter <counter> <on/off>`.
* The category commands are combined too. They are now subcommands, `m!category create` and `m!category update`.
* You now require the `Administrator` permission to use the main commands, such as `m!setup` and `m!category`, instead of `Manage Server`.
* The bot no longer requires the `Administrator` permission. These are the permissions it needs now: 

  ```text
  Read Messages
  Send Messages
  Manage Channels
  Manage Roles
  Attach Files
  Connect
  Embed Links
  ```

* The counter name is completely customizable now, which means that you can move the count to any part of the name, instead of just after the `:`. Example: `m!countername user {count} amazing people` will change the counter name to `99 amazing people`. \(Patrons only\)

### Greatly improved uptime

* Changed to Eris \(another js library\) due to the poor memory management in Discord.js.
* Switched out of the legacy sharding. We now use Node.js's cluster module to spread shards more evenly.
* Clustering and improvements for shard management. This essentially means that the main process will reconnect the shards if needed. This also means that the memory issue is FIXED!
* Many more smaller changes for performance improvements and bug fixes.

### _**What's next?**_

The new counters are automatically enabled for existing servers, they will show up when a role/channel is created/deleted. You can also use the command `m!counter update` and the counters will be created. The documentation is a work in progress. Meanwhile, if you have any questions, try using `m!help <command>`, or ask in this server.
