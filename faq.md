# FAQ

## Why is Member Count not responding?

Please check the following before asking for help. 

* Make sure the bot has `Read Messages`, `Send Messages`, and `Embed Links` permissions. 
* Make sure the bot is online. Discord might be having issues, or the bot might be restarting.

## Can I change the prefix?

Yes, you can. Use the command `m!prefix <new prefix>`. You can also mention the bot with the command. So if you forgot the prefix, you can do `@Member Count#7205 prefix`.

## How do I turn off a counter?

Run [`m!counter <counter> <on/off>`](commands-extended.md#counter). For the counter, choose from the following:`- members (users + bots)  
- users (humans)  
- bots (bots)  
- roles (total roles)  
- channels (total channels)`

 Premium counters:   
`- role (members in a role)   
- online (online members)   
- offline (offline members)` 

As for the role option, the usage is slightly different: `m!counter role <add/remove> <role>` where `<role>` can either be a mention or the name of the role \(case sensitive\).

## How do I change the counter names?

Use the command [`m!countername <counter> <name>`](commands-extended.md#counter-name-patrons-only), and include `{count}` in the name where you want the number to be at. This feature is for Patrons only. You can donate at [https://www.patreon.com/member\_count](https://www.patreon.com/member_count).

## What are the permissions the bot needs for all commands to work?

Here's the list:

```text
Read Messages
Send Messages
Manage Channels
Manage Roles
Attach Files
Connect
Embed Links
```

## Can the bot display a count other than these options? \(e.g. YouTube subscription\)

As of now, those are the only counters available. If you have any suggestions, do tell us in [\#suggestions](https://discord.gg/dWMgWWw)!

## How do I prevent normal users from using the commands?

All counter related commands are already restricted to users with the `Administrator` permission. To prevent usage of other commands, restrict the bot under channel settings: `Permissions` &gt; `Add Member` &gt; `Member Count` &gt; `Select â•³ under Send Messages`. Note that this will prevent you from being able to use the bot in that channel as well.

## Can I manually update the counters?

Yes, you can. Simply run `m!counter update`.

## Why are the counters duplicating/not updating?

Please ensure that the bot has the correct permissions to the counters \(i.e. `See Voice Channel`, `Manage Channel` and `Connect`\).

## Can I change the bot's username and avatar?

No, username and avatar are global. Changing it will affect all servers Member Count is on. You can only change the bot's nickname under Manage User, if you ****have the `Manage Nicknames` permission.

## Can I self-host the bot?

No, you can't. The bot's code is closed source.
